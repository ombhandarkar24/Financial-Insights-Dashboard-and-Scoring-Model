# Financial Insights Dashboard and Scoring Model

This project provides a financial insights dashboard and scoring model that helps users track and analyze their financial health. The system includes a Flask API backend to calculate a financial score based on input data, a Streamlit frontend to interact with the model, and visualizations to display the results and insights.

## Dataset Information

The dataset used in this project contains financial data for families and individuals, including:

- **Family ID**: Unique identifier for the family.
- **Member ID**: Unique identifier for the family member.
- **Income**: Monthly income of the family member.
- **Savings**: Savings amount for the individual or family.
- **Expenses**: Monthly expenses, including discretionary and necessary costs.
- **Loan Payments**: Loan repayment amounts, such as mortgages, personal loans, etc.
- **Credit Card Spending**: Monthly credit card expenditure.
- **Goals Met**: Percentage of financial goals that the individual or family has met.

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

In this project, we perform several preprocessing and cleaning steps on the input data:

1. **Missing Data Handling**: We ensure all required fields are populated. If any data is missing, it is flagged for manual correction.
2. **Normalization**: The financial inputs (income, savings, expenses, etc.) are normalized on a 0-1 scale to handle varying ranges and ensure consistency in the scoring model.
3. **Outliers**: Outlier detection and removal steps were performed to ensure the model doesnâ€™t get skewed by extreme values.

The goal of these preprocessing steps is to make the data ready for model input and ensure that financial scoring is accurate and fair.

## Flask API Setup Instructions

To set up and run the Flask API, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ombhandarkar24/Financial-Insights-Dashboard-and-Scoring-Model.git
cd Financial-Insights-Dashboard-and-Scoring-Model
```

### 2. Install dependencies

Create a virtual environment and install the required dependencies:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the Flask API

After setting up the environment, run the Flask API:

```bash
python app.py
```

This will start the Flask server at `http://localhost:5000/`.

### 4. API Endpoints

The Flask API has the following endpoints:

- **POST /calculate_score**: Accepts input data for financial information and returns a calculated financial score.
  - Input: JSON data (income, savings, expenses, etc.)
  - Output: Financial score and insights.

## Streamlit API Setup Instructions

To set up the Streamlit API, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the repository

If you haven't already cloned the repository, run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ombhandarkar24/Financial-Insights-Dashboard-and-Scoring-Model.git
cd Financial-Insights-Dashboard-and-Scoring-Model
```

### 2. Install dependencies

In the same virtual environment, install Streamlit and other dependencies:

```bash
pip install streamlit
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run Streamlit App

Start the Streamlit application by running the following command:

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

This will start the Streamlit app in your browser at `http://localhost:8501/`.

## Financial Scoring Logic and Weights

The financial score is calculated based on several factors, each with a specific weight. The following are the components that contribute to the final financial score:

1. **Income**: Contributes up to 30 points. Higher income contributes more to the score.
2. **Savings**: Contributes up to 25 points. Higher savings indicate better financial health.
3. **Expenses**: Contributes up to 15 points. Lower monthly expenses lead to a higher score.
4. **Loan Payments**: Contributes up to 10 points. Lower loan repayments lead to a higher score.
5. **Credit Card Spending**: Contributes up to 10 points. Lower credit card spending improves the score.
6. **Financial Goals Met**: Contributes up to 10 points. Meeting more financial goals increases the score.

### Calculation Logic

```python
# Normalize inputs (0-1 scale)
income_score = income_normalized * 30  # Income contributes up to 30 points
savings_score = savings_normalized * 25  # Savings contribute up to 25 points
expenses_score = (1 - expenses_normalized) * 15  # Lower expenses contribute up to 15 points
loan_score = (1 - loan_payments_normalized) * 10  # Lower loan payments contribute up to 10 points
credit_score = (1 - credit_spending_normalized) * 10  # Lower credit card spending contributes up to 10 points
goals_met_score = goals_met_normalized * 10  # Financial goals contribute up to 10 points
```

The total score is calculated by summing the individual scores for each category. The final score is then clamped between 0 and 100.

### Final Clamped Score:
```python
score = max(0, min(100, score))
```

## Recommendations for Improving Financial Scores

Based on the calculated financial score, the system provides personalized recommendations to improve financial health:

- **If the score is low (<50)**: Recommendations include reducing discretionary spending (e.g., Food, Entertainment, Travel) by 10%, which could improve the score.
- **If the score is moderate (50-80)**: Recommendations are provided to help improve overall financial management.
- **If the score is high (>80)**: Congratulations! The system provides tips to maintain or further enhance financial health.

### Example Recommendations:

- "Reduce your discretionary spending by 10%, which could improve your score by X points."
- "Increase your savings by 5%, which could improve your score by Y points."

## Visualizations

The Streamlit app includes several visualizations to help users better understand their financial health:

1. **Distribution of Financial Scores**: A histogram displaying the distribution of financial scores across multiple families/individuals.
2. **Income vs Expenses Visualization**: A bar chart comparing income and expenses for each family member.
3. **Savings Over Time**: A line chart displaying savings trends over several months.

These visualizations provide a clear and intuitive way to view financial health at a glance.
